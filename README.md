As Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz prepared to retire on June 30, 2017, Roll Call used this script to parse his most recent tweets, up to the Twitter API cap, then analyze them. Roll Call published the [graphic story](http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/measuring-chaffetzs-legacy-twitter) using this analaysis on June 29. 

The Jupyter Notebook analysis using Twitter's API can be found in [chaffetz_tweets.ipynb](https://github.com/cqrollcall-datateam/chaffetz-tweets/blob/master/chaffetz_tweets.ipynb)
